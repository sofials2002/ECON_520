My class notes for Data Science for Economics 

Hello! I'm Sofia Lozano. I'm in the process of learning how to use GitHub as part of my workflow. SO I thought writing making a repo for my class notes would be a good way of using github as an environment. ðŸ‘ŠðŸ’»ðŸŒž

- I'll separate my notes by lecture.
- I'll make comments on what I learn each time.
- I'll reach out with any challenges/roadblocks.

Good luck to me!
