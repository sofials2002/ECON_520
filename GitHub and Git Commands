$ git add NAME-OF-FILE-OR-FOLDER

1: staging: 

To stage a new file: 
$ git add .

To stage all files: 
$ git add -A

$ git commit -m "Helpful message"

3: pulling:
pulling from the upstream repo (GitHub): 
$ git pull

4: Pushing: 
pushing any local changes from your desktop upstream: 
$ git push

** Note: to avoid merging conflicts, always PULL before you PUSH!!!
Solving merging conflicts: Manually editing the README file. 
Person who fixes the merge conflics gets to decide what to keep. 
Another solution (more elegant and democratic) is using Branches. 

How does Git track changes? 
By evaluating an invisible character at the end of every line.

For Linux and MacOS, that ending is "LF".
For Windows, that ending is "CRLF"
These line endings for the different OS (operating systems) can be conflicting.
